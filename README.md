Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
sotfware engineering is the ystematic application of engineering principles to the design, development and maintenance of the software and its importance is it helps in problem solving, scalability and efficiency to meet users needs


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i)The birth of software engineering which was first introduced in 1986 it marked the begining of structured software  development methodologie 
ii)the rise of structured programming which was introduced in 1970-1980.breaks programs into smaller reusable functions using control structures
iii)The agile manifesto and modern development methodologies which was introduced in 2001 and it emphasize iterative development and flexibility

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.planning-comng uo with an idea,objectives,requirement of a project
2.analysis-gathering and documenting functional and non functional requirements
3.design-creating a blueprint for the software
4.implemenation-writing the actual code based on the design specifications
5.testing-identifying and fixing the bugs

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
watefall approach in a linear and sequential way while agile approach is iterative and increamental for example when a bank want to develop a new banking syst

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPE
coding,designing and implementing software applications
QUALITY ASSSUARANCE ENGINEER
ensuring that the software is free of bugs , meet requirements,and fuctions correctly before release
PROJECT MANAGER
oversees the entire software development process ensuring that the projects are completed on time 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE enances productivity for example features like syntax highlighting ,auto cocompletion speeds up development eg;visual studio code
VCS enhances collaboration-teams can work on different part of a project simultenously and merge teir changes easily  eg;git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
CHALLEGE;difficulty in finding and and fixing bugs especially in large complex code bases
STRATEGY;use of debugging tools
CHALLEGE;tight project deadline and multiple tasks
STRATEGY;use project managemet tools
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit-test idividual components or modues 
intergrated testing-verifies interaction between intergrated components
system testing-test the complete system as a whole to ensure it meets the requirement
acceptance testin-performed by the end users to validate if the software meets their needs before deployment
IMPORTANCES;
ensures all functions of the software works as expected
identifies bugs early in the development proces


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs prompts to optimise the responses generated byt AI models
and its importance is it enhances response quality

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
example; tell me about technology
improved;explain the impact of artificial intelligence on the job market including both benefits and challeges
i)more specific-instead of broadly asking about technology it focuses on a particular topic
